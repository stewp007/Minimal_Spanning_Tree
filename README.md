# Project 5: Minimal Spanning Tree
For this project, you will implement Prim's algorithm for computing a minimal spanning tree of the graph.
Project description is posted on Canvas. You may also implement Kruskal's algorithm for computing MST (this will be extra credit - please talk to the instructor prior to implementing it).
